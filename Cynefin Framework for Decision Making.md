The Cynefin Framework for leadership aims to be able to make decisions and control the situation according to the **kinds of situations there are and the whole team finds itself**, where these kinds can be **simple, complicated, complex and chaotic**  

The first 2, simple and complicated, are the basic and easy kinds to manage situations, which address how the situation could be improved via **asking experts of the domain** what could be the recommended thing to do **according to the known information we have**  
On the other hand, complex and chaotic, need a special treatment where, instead of relying on experts and best general practices or heuristics, **we rely on asking to the situation itself what is the recommended thing to do**, this is more abstract because we are in the realm of the **unknown unknowns**, this delves around **getting the information** that the **current specific situation offers**, **recognizing patterns** and then based of those patterns **find a solution with probes and experiments** to check how well would the devised solution fare based on the complex or chaotic nature of the situation, an example would be the management of a community in a city that suffered a terrorist attack and the community has been compromised, and the reason this is a complex problem, is because of the nature of the community, which is more than the sum of its parts  
> The reason this is like this is because of the difference between complicated and complex, complicated is something that is composed of various parts, and the sum of these parts results in the situation, which has a more ordered and static nature  
> Whereas a complex situation has a more dynamic nature, where the situation is **more than the sum of its parts**, has emergent features from the components and **does not have a balance**, rather is **shifting between states**, like planets orbiting around themselves never finding a critical point of balance, and lastly where the **components are being changed between states because of attractors**(which are a philosophical term for a sort of state which the components **gravitate**around, but may be attracted to other attractors and thus forming an ever-changing state)

Simple situations have a clear solution by anyone and it is easy to know what the **best thing to do** is, as in the **known knowns**, and **categorization** is easy  
Complicated situations on the other hand require **analysis** to know what to do, and when identifying the problem, calling experts of the domain to know the best or recommended course of action, this is like having a car and knowing there is something wrong because of noises, but the problem may be complicated because of all the components of the car, and we consult with a mechanic  

For complex situations, the **recommended management practices and heuristics will result in failure**, because when we are in a situation like this, then the problems can't be **analyzed** nor broken down, and the problems are things that were not seen before or has a dynamic and disordered nature, this is when we need to **identify patterns and attractors in the situation, and then probe and experiment** in fail-safe environments to be able to recognize what **what influences the situation** to a more desirable situation(as in becoming experts of the current problem), after testing solution that make use of the patterns and the attractors that drive the situation in an unpredictable manner, we check the results to know if we need more tests or we are ready to take action, and then execute the solution, an example could be the terrorist attack resulting in a community worried of going outside and performing their social roles, where instead of commanding and trying to fit in solutions that worked in other contexts or heuristics, we hear the concerns of the community and study what is driving them to not perform their roles, study and test how their concerns could be addressed, and execute the solution  

For chaotic situations, where components of the situation are not clear and there is too much factors affecting the functions of known and working components, then we need to recover rather than finding for right solutions, this involves shifting from chaos to a complex situation, trying to put order where its possible, identify where there is already order and stability, and from that make other parts become stable
