- **Interaction**: This refers to the way system components communicate and work together, ensuring that these interactions are secure
- **Representation**: This is about how security relationships between system components are defined and represented to maintain a secure system
It focuses on viewpoints, which are:

- **Security Viewpoint**: Describes the security goals and related aspects
- **Process Viewpoint**: Establishes a clear methodology to define the security of the system
